# Don't Panic

Most literature on the Internet documents [eBPF](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/index.html) from a user's perspective.
However, for OS developers or someone who just needs to write an eBPF implementation from scratch for whatever reason,
they will most likely have to turn to the Linux source code due to a lack of documentation.

This site tries to provide some implementation details of eBPF in Linux,
in the hope that it will pick up some hitchhikers on the way.
